📊 Power BI Dashboard: FoodMart Sales Analysis

I developed a multi-page dashboard to analyze sales, profit, and customer trends across 21 countries, enabling deeper business insights and faster decision-making.

Page 1 – Overview: Global snapshot of sales, profit, and performance trends with interactive filters.

Page 2 – Country Analysis: Country-wise breakdown of sales, profitability, customer segmentation, and target achievement.

Page 3 – Cluster Analysis: Comparison across clusters, highlighting category dominance, country contributions, and goal tracking.

🔍 This dashboard demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights, supporting strategic decision-making from global to granular levels.
